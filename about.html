    <p>
        Hello, I am a full stack web developer, specializing in Javascript and ethical coding.
        <br>
        <br>
        I graduated from one of the best universities in the world, The University of Texas at Austin.
        I studied front and back end engineering, databases, ReactJS, Python, and many other useful development tools.
        <br>
        <br>
        I currently utilize my skills to teach basic web development, business development, and finance courses 
        to students all across the world, through my non profit organization, Global Integrity.
        <br>
        <br>
        I hope you enjoy looking through all the projects on my portfolio page, and be sure to
